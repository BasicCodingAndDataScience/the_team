 Homelessness is an ever-rising problem throughout our world. Though it may seem like we live in a beautiful and prosperous country, we are surrounded by many unfortunate people right here at home and we barely ever notice it. No matter where you live, be it New York or California, Washington or Florida, there are homeless people residing in many major cities. This has definitely become a huge topic of conversation for the past few years. As time progresses, people are becoming more aware of the situation and there are more shelters in cities throughout the US. People want to help, and by helping they are also helping their cities. By getting homeless people off the street, the people are making their cities prosperous and beautiful, while also adding new people to their cities' workforces. This has been going on for years now, but, by analyzing data, can we detect a visble change over the years? From 2008 to 2016, was there a visible decrease in the amount of homeless people in every state and the capital?
