 Homelessness is an ever-rising problem throughout our world. Though it may seem like we live in a beautiful and prosperous country, we are surrounded by many unfortunate people right here at home and we barely ever notice it. No matter where you live, be it New York or California, Washington or Florida, there are homeless people residing in many towns and cities throughout the country. This has definitely become a huge topic of conversation in recent years. As time progresses, people are becoming more aware of the situation and there are more shelters in cities throughout the country. Homelessness is a serious problem, and it is necessary to do something about it. So, we looked for answers to a few questions: What age range are most homeless people in? How many homeless war veterans are there in the US? How many homeless people are there in each state as of 2016? These are just a few of the questions we answered by gathering data and analyzing it.
